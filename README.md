# Aphasia-project

Description

Patients that suffer from Aphasia have difficulty comprehending and/or formulating language. 
The cause is usually brain damage in the language center. Recovery from Aphasia is usually never 100%, and rehab can take years but does help the patients. 
Regardless, having Aphasia is usually very stressful for the patients even during rehabilitation sessions. Specialists from the Rijndam rehabilitation institute in Rotterdam treat patients that suffer from Aphasia. 
Their impression is that the stress experienced by patients may be amplified by human-human interaction in which the patients experience the 'embarrassment' of not being able to communicate correctly. 
Possibly, the rehabilition stress can be reduced by having patients do exercises on a computer rather than to talk to a person. For this project the first goal is to see if we can properly translate what Aphasia patients say to text and identify where they likely make mistakes in their language.
